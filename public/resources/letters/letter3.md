# Maqbool Bhat to Abdul Khaliq Ansari

**Rex Hotel, Rawalpindi**  
**22nd December 1970**

**Respected Abdul Khaliq Ansari Sahib,**

**Greetings,**

I hope you are in good health. Considering the shifting political landscape of Pakistan, I have summoned a few friends to Lahore on Sunday, the 27th of December, for consultations regarding the party’s political campaign and to deliberate on some crucial matters. Your presence at this gathering is essential.

God willing, I will visit your residence in Mirpur at any time after noon on the 26th of December, so that we may depart for Lahore together. I am fully mindful of your health concerns, yet the present circumstances demand that we move forward with urgency, lest our destination remain distant. I trust that you will bear this slight inconvenience.

If you find it appropriate, you may also persuade Chaudhry Shehbaz Khan¹ Sahib and Sufi Muhammad Zaman to join us. I believe their presence would prove beneficial.

**Yours sincerely,**  
## Mohammad Maqbool Bhat
