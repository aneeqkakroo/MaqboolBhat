# Maqbool Bhat to Dr. Farooq Haider

**Tihar Jail, New Delhi**  
**20th June 1982**

**Brother Farooq Haider Sahib,**

Peace be upon you.

I received your affectionate letter dated 26 May 1982. After a long time, I write these few lines to inform you of my well-being. It is certainly not the case that you have faded from my mind; however, what can be said of this period of imprisonment, where desires and affections are inevitably forced to bow to “circumstances”.

A few days ago, I received a letter from Sarwar Sahib in London. He conveyed the tragic news that our brother Malik Aftab Sahib¹ has passed away. Indeed, to Allah we belong and to Him we shall return.

Since death is a truth, there is no escape from it. However, those who die leave behind memories that inevitably leave their marks. The memories associated with the late Aftab Sahib will remain fresh in our minds for a long time to come. I pray that Allah grants him a place in His mercy and bestows upon you and the other bereaved family members the strength to bear this calamity with patience. Please convey my condolences and sympathy to the late Sahib’s two sons.

By the grace of God, my health is perfectly fine, and I am spending my days in patience and gratitude. All other conditions remain unchanged. I will make an effort to ensure that this correspondence continues in the future.

Please convey my heartfelt greetings to all friends and family.

Wassalam,  
Your brother,  
**Muhammad Maqbool Bhat**
