# Maqbool Bhat to Ikrāmullāh Jaswāl

**Respected and Honourable Jaswāl Sahib,**

Assalamu Alaikum!

The letter of affection you entrusted to the post on the 17th of last month reached me some time ago. However, for certain reasons, I was delayed in responding, for which I seek your pardon. The concern you and other friends feel due to the delay in receiving news of my well-being is not only understandable but also a significant sign of the bond of sincerity and love that has existed between us for years—nurtured by all of us with the lifeblood of our hearts. Believe me, at times, the delay on my part is not intentional but rather a result of the constraints of imprisonment. I always strive to respond to the letters of friends, and I have never been negligent in this regard. However, it so happens that some of my replies disappear along the way, disrupting this innocent exchange of letters. In the present circumstances, what else can be done except to endure? "What cannot be cured must be endured." When there is no remedy for an ailment, what alternative remains but to endure it with patience? Nevertheless, rest assured that the memories associated with you remain as fresh in my mind and heart as ever, despite the long adversities of time, and their freshness continues to be the greatest source of strength for my patience and perseverance.

The heartfelt emotions of sincerity and love you have expressed towards me are a priceless treasure. In public life, no honour or pride is greater for a person than the unwavering bond with their companions—established not by self-interest or the necessities of time but upon the grand human values of conscious harmony, sincerity, loyalty, love, and sacrifice. The spontaneous prayers emerging from the depths of the hearts of friends like you are not only living symbols of this selfless affection, which we can rightfully take pride in, but they are also sufficient to invoke divine mercy for our success in this time of trial and tribulation. Rest assured, where determination is youthful, courage is high, and the spirit of action is present, the prayers on one's lips reflect the aspirations and desires that have always adorned and propelled human efforts. So, continue this chain of prayers so that divine mercy may be stirred and this difficult time may soon pass. Ameen.

By the grace of Allah, my health is perfectly fine. The conditions of imprisonment remain unchanged, and thus, I continue to pass my time with patience and gratitude. Some time ago, I was transferred from Ward No. 18 to Ward No. 16, which is referred to in prison parlance as the "Hanging Barrack." The difference is that where there was once solitude, I now have the opportunity to meet some fellow prisoners, making time pass with a little more "engagement." Do not forget to mention 'Ward No. 16' in your next letter.

My sincere greetings to you and, through you, to all friends. I hope you will keep me informed of your well-being from time to time.

Wassalam,  
Seeking your prayers,
