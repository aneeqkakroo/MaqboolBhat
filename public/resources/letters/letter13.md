# Maqbool Bhat to Muhammad Arif

**Central Jail, New Delhi**  
**8 October 1980**

**Dear Muhammad Arif Sahib,**

**Assalamu Alaikum,**

I received your letter of condolence. The sincere and heartfelt emotions you expressed regarding the passing of my late wife have been a great source of strength for me in this difficult time, and for that, I am grateful to you.

It is an eternal truth that no living soul can escape death. Thus, for the people of faith, there is no room for grief and sorrow in this matter. However, on a personal level, I do feel sorrow that, in the final stages of her journey through life, I was unable to fulfil the rights and duties that are expected between spouses. The helplessness one feels before the tyranny of circumstances is doubly intensified in such a situation. If this feeling can be called a shock, then I have certainly endured a great one. Perhaps this is why, amidst the desolation of this prison, the love and sympathy expressed by you and many other friends at this moment have helped me to remain steadfast. Thus, I cannot refrain from expressing my gratitude to you.

One cannot deny your view that those who lead a life of purpose must inevitably pass through trials and tribulations. The loftier and nobler the objectives, the greater the intensity of these trials. Even while passing through the stages of the gallows and the noose, people of faith and determination do not let their foreheads crease with worry, for they know that in the struggle between truth and falsehood, in the end,

> *“Do not weaken and do not grieve, for you will be superior if you are [true] believers.”*  
> **(Qur’an 3:139)**

—this divine promise always manifests in all its splendour.

These individuals, despite their apparent destitution and lack of resources, do not fear the abundance of means at the disposal of the enemies of truth. Not because their passion for the journey has made them reckless and thoughtless, but because the nature of their struggle is such that oftentimes,

> *“How many a small group has overcome a large group by the permission of Allah.”*  
> **(Qur’an 2:249)**

—this miracle reveals itself in all its magnificence. The only condition is that their perseverance must not waver. Thus, pray that Allah bestows upon us the blessing of patience and steadfastness so that, in the trials we face, our steps do not falter, and our resolve remains firm.

I was pleased to learn that you are among the friends of my dear **Javaid**. I can well understand the pain and sorrow he must have felt at his mother’s passing in my absence. However, I trust that the companionship and support of friends like you will help him endure this grief. I hope that in this regard, you will not fall short in any way.

Your letter informed me that you are well acquainted with my dear friend and comrade, **Mr. Amanullah Khan**. This is no less than a great joy for me. I hope that you will convey my sincere greetings to him. Years ago, I received a letter of kindness from him, but for understandable reasons, he could not continue the correspondence. The memories associated with him remain fresh in my mind, and the dust of time has not dimmed their radiance. I would be pleased if you could also inform my friends in **Mirpur** of my well-being through a letter and convey my greetings to them.

By the grace of the Almighty, my health is perfectly fine, and there is no need for any concern or worry in this regard. I hope that you will continue to remember me through letters in the future.

**Wasalam,**
