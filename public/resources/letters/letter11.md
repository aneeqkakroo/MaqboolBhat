# Maqbool Bhat to Malik Muhammad Asghar

**Central Jail, New Delhi**  
**6 March 1980**

**Brother Malik Muhammad Asghar Sahib,**

**Assalamu Alaikum,**

I have received your first letter, which you likely wrote in early February. Many thanks for remembering me.

In this solitude, these tokens of remembrance from friends like you¹ bring immense joy—something only I can truly understand. Earlier, when my brother² visited me, a flood of memories associated with you was rekindled. Learning of your well-being and that of other friends brought me solace, and now, through your letter, those…³ which can rightfully be called our invaluable heritage.

The anguish and anxiety you have expressed are a reflection of your deep sincerity, love, sacrifice, and loyalty. However, I do not understand why you consider yourself a *“criminal,”* especially when there is no accuser to begin with⁴. That is another matter, for there are certain *“crimes”* that bring immense pride to people of determination and faith. Surely, among them is not the *“crime of weakness,”* for which the punishment is a sudden death. Rather, it is the *“crime”* of rebellion—one that ignites faith and conviction within the enslaved, urging even the most insignificant sparrow to dare a contest with the falcon. Such a *“crime”* does not call for remorse but rather for celebration.

The verse you have written does not seem appropriate to my situation, for there is no room for lament here. Seeking praise for victories and sympathy for failures by blaming circumstances cannot be considered the highest and noblest of life’s values. However, if I may be forgiven for my audacity, then with utmost humility, I must say:

> Hamen khabar hai ke hum hain chiragh-e-akhir-e-shab  
> Hamaare baad andhera nahin, ujala hai  
>
> *We know that we are the lamps of the final hour of night,*  
> *After us, there shall be no darkness, only light.*

This applies not just to me but to all of us. Hence, there is no need for regret or sorrow⁵. I firmly believe that the wealth of sincerity, love, determination, and faith that we safeguard shall surely lead our endeavours on the path of truth to ultimate success. There is no need for a lengthy discourse on this subject. It is an eternal truth that has always existed in the annals of human history with all its radiant splendour and shall continue to do so.

There is no dearth of blossoms in this ever-blooming garden of human history—provided that we do not, in our ignorance, become content with merely a few buds.

It brings me joy that you remember me in your prayers. I hope you will continue to extend your heartfelt prayers for me. You mentioned Eid cards, but I never received them. Nevertheless, I thank you once again for remembering me on such joyous occasions. I also extend my gratitude for your message regarding the well-being of my dear ones, **Javaid** and **Shaukat**.

Please convey my warm regards, filled with sincerity and love, to all our friends. I hope this exchange of letters shall continue.

**Wassalam,**  
**Only Yours,**  
**Your Brother,**

*(Note)*: Please inform me about the condition of **Brother Ejaz Malik**. I am deeply distressed about the state he is in. Convey my special greetings to him. Also, extend my message of sympathy to his loved ones.

### Footnotes

1. “Tokens” refer to letters sent by friends.  
2. Ghulam Nabi Bhat.  
3. Due to the deterioration of the letter, a few words could not be deciphered.  
4. Malik Asghar Sahib had expressed feelings of shame and remorse for not being able to secure Maqbool Bhat’s release.  
5. Malik Asghar Sahib had written a verse by **Mustafa Zaidi**:

   > Kuch main hi jaanta hoon jo mujh par guzar gayi  
   > Duniya to lutf legi mere waqiat mein  
   >
   > *Only I truly know what I have endured,*  
   > *The world shall merely delight in my tales.*

   This verse carried a sense of despair and hopelessness, which is why Bhat Sahib spoke of living with hope and resilience.
