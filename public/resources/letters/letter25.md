# Maqbool Bhat to Malik Ghulam Sarwar

**Central Jail, New Delhi**  
**31st May 1981**

**Respected Sarwar Sahib,**

Assalamu-u-Alaikum,

After a long time, I received your affectionate letter. Countless thanks to Allah Almighty that you are well. There is no doubt that life in a foreign land follows such routines that one is constantly engulfed by a lack of time. However, given the circumstances we face, this brief and uncertain exchange of letters holds great significance. Not only does it keep the lamps of our memories alight, but in this period of trial, it also strengthens our resolve. Therefore, while expressing my gratitude for your remembrance, I hope that despite your busy schedule, you will continue this correspondence in the future.

I agree with your view that to achieve success and triumph in life, one must pass through thorny paths and rugged mountains. Those who, citing the unfavourability of circumstances and the hardships of the journey, hesitate to give practical shape to their cherished ideals—deliberately allowing themselves to drift with the current—are, in truth, committing a great injustice to their own lives. To abandon the path of struggle and action merely due to adverse circumstances, despite possessing intellect and awareness, is a sin for which there is no atonement. Pray that Allah Almighty keeps our lives free from the taint of this sin and grants us the strength to remain steadfast on the path of faith and action to the best of our ability.

"Rabbana wa la tuḥammilnā mā lā ṭāqata lanā bih. Wa'fu 'annā, waghfir lanā, warḥamnā. Anta mawlānā fanṣurnā 'ala al-qawm il-kāfirīn."

"O our Lord, do not burden us with what we cannot bear. Pardon us, forgive us, and have mercy upon us. You are our Protector, so grant us victory over the disbelieving people." (Ameen)

The bank draft of 30 pounds that you sent along with your letter has been received. It has not yet been cashed, as it was handed over to the jail authorities for processing. And you are well aware of the remarkable efficiency with which government machinery operates in this part of the world, aren't you?¹ Your letter actually arrived about a month and a half ago, but for certain reasons, I was delayed in replying, for which I apologise.

My health is perfectly fine, and I am enduring my days in captivity with patience and gratitude. About a month ago, I was transferred from Ward No. 18 to Ward No. 16, which in jail terminology is referred to as the "execution block." Previously, I was in complete isolation; now, I have the opportunity to interact with some death-row prisoners. Other conditions remain unchanged. These days, the heat is at its peak, and being confined to the cell 24 hours a day makes my body feel like a fish out of water. The rest is well.

Do not forget to convey my greetings to all our friends. Recently, Brother Asghar Sahib also sent a letter from Kotli, which I intend to reply to soon.

Wassalam.  
Khuda Hafiz.

Your well-wisher,  
**Muhammad Maqbool Bhat**

¹ Whenever a friend sent money to Maqbool Bhat Shaheed, the jail authorities would deliberately delay cashing the bank draft for months.
