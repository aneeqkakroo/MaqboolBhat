# Maqbool Bhat to Dr. Farooq Haider

**Brother Farooq Haider Sahib,**

Assalamu Alaikum,

A while ago, I received the parcel of clothes you had sent.² A few days later, I also received your affectionate letter. I am grateful to you for both.

It is enough for me that, despite this long separation, you still hold my memories close to your heart. And the truth is that, with the support of these memories, these days of imprisonment—despite the hardships of solitude—are becoming easier to endure. Your complaint is valid that I have not written to you for a long time. It is not that your memory has faded from my mind, nor that I have nothing to write. Even in this period of imprisonment, I encounter numerous experiences that are certainly worth mentioning.³ However, most of these experiences tend to be bitter. And you have no idea that, in this prison, being classified as a Top Security Prisoner, the bitterness of my experiences is even greater. That said, after enduring such trying conditions for so long, I have now grown accustomed to them, to the point that I barely feel their sting anymore. Smiling in the face of hardships has become my second nature. Yet, I do not wish to add to the pain of sensitive friends like you by recounting such experiences. My disposition now aligns with the words of a film poet: "We alone shall suffer the punishment for our crime of love." As for the transgressions of others, complaining is of no use.

Nevertheless, I admit that I have been negligent in informing you of my well-being, and for that, I apologise. However, I must mention that I have always responded to each letter of yours that I have received. For me, there has never been any reason to delay replying once a letter arrives. Therefore, if you continue this exchange of letters, there is no reason why you should not continue receiving news of my welfare. In this matter, you are in a better position than I am.

It pleased me to learn that you had travelled to Peshawar and met my family members there. Due to my respected uncle's old age, I often remain worried about him, especially since his health is not good. In this regard, all I can do is pray. I hope you will make every effort to uplift his spirits so that I may feel somewhat relieved about this concern. I trust that your advice will help alleviate the helplessness he feels in my absence. Over the past two months, I have not received any letter from him, so I do not know to what extent he has been able to resolve his immediate issues. Please encourage him to keep me informed about his circumstances at regular intervals.

By the grace of God, my health is perfectly fine, and I continue to endure the days of imprisonment with patience and gratitude. Everything else remains the same. Your letter provided news of the well-being of our friends, for which I am grateful. Please not only inform them of my well-being but also convey my heartfelt greetings to them. In recent days, I also sent a letter to the esteemed Jaswal Sahib, which he has likely received by now.

Extend my special greetings to you and your family. Lots of love to little Sultan Haider. In your next letter, do write about the education of Izzah and Manzah.

Wasalam,  
Your brother,  
**Mohammad Maqbool Bhat**

¹ Maqbool Bhat Shaheed forgot to write the date on this letter. However, the postal stamp on the aerogramme in Rawalpindi clearly reads 30-APR-81.  
² Dr. Farooq Haider had sent stitched clothes to Maqbool Bhat Shaheed.  
³ Even in the worst solitary confinement, Maqbool Bhat Shaheed’s observation of life remained remarkably clear.
