# Maqbool Bhat to Malik Ijaz Ahmad

**Central Jail, New Delhi**  
**3 February 1981**

**Dear Ijaz Ahmad,**

**Assalamu Alaikum!**

I received your letter—many thanks for remembering me. The memory of that unfortunate incident, which befell us exactly five years ago in **Rawalpindi**, still lingers in my mind¹. However, I had assumed that the period of medical treatment you underwent at **CMH** had been sufficient for the restoration of your mental and physical vitality. It never even crossed my mind that you would endure such a prolonged psychological affliction.

I first learned about the severity of your condition and its consequences from a letter sent to me last year by **Brother Asghar**. Believe me, ever since then, I have remained deeply concerned and have expressed this in several letters to friends. But what can one say of these towering barriers that stand between innocent bonds of correspondence—preventing me from fulfilling my duty of companionship towards you, and equally, from acquiring any updates about your condition? Even Brother Asghar did not write again after that. Under such circumstances, what else could I do but remember you in my prayers? Believe me, those prayers have always been dedicated to you and shall remain so.

It pleases me to know that you have now significantly recovered. Your letter gave me this impression, and I am confident that with continued treatment, a full recovery is not out of the question. You must continue your treatment with patience, calmness, and absolute confidence, leaving no effort undone in the process. This is my advice to both you and those responsible for your care. In today’s age, no illness is considered incurable, provided that struggle and effort remain unwavering.

Your letter was like a beautiful bouquet of poetry, entirely suited to the occasion, bringing a touch of spring to the lifeless confines of this prison cell. Who can deny the fact that crucifixion was always the destiny of every **Christ**, and perhaps it remains so in every era? Yet, despite this, the **Gospel of Enlightenment** was opened. The terror of the cross could not close its pages, nor will it ever succeed in doing so—why? Because, as a poet once said:

> *Qatl-gāhoñ se chun kar hamāre ʿalam*  
> *Aur nikleñge ʿashāq ke qāfile*²  

*“From execution grounds, our banners shall be lifted,  
And new caravans of lovers shall set forth.”*

This is not mere poetic fancy but an immutable law of nature—a principle that has adorned human history throughout the ages. It is this very conviction that has enabled the messengers of truth and righteousness to embrace martyrdom at the hands of tyrants with unwavering resolve—and they shall continue to do so.

As for the notion that an honest merchant finds himself amidst a horde of blind buyers, that is but an illusion. Humanity, in its entirety, has never been blind. It is merely that, for a time, the darkness of the night may obscure the value and significance of the mirror of truth. Even in such circumstances, however, there is no cause for grief or sorrow for those who possess determination and faith—for, as you yourself have put it, even in darkness, they can always hear the blossoming of the bud of truth and the chime of the goblet of enlightenment.

By the grace of the Almighty, my health is perfectly fine, and I am spending these days of imprisonment with patience and composure. There is nothing more worth mentioning about myself, for, in your words, *“This is not the time for tales of the night of sorrow.”* The journey ahead is still long, and the story of this voyage is best told when it reaches its completion.

Convey my heartfelt greetings and affection to all our friends through you. I hope you will continue to remember me from time to time.

**Wassalam,**  
**Ever in need of your prayers,**  
## *Mohammad Maqbool Bhat*

1. This was the **first week of January 1976**. Malik Ijaz had travelled to Rawalpindi to attend an **NLF meeting**. After the meeting, while travelling towards **Saddar Bazaar**, Maqbool Bhat, Malik Ijaz, and Dr. Farooq Haider met with an accident near the **Racecourse Ground**. Maqbool Bhat sustained minor injuries, whereas Malik Ijaz suffered a severe head injury, remained unconscious for several days at **MH Rawalpindi**, and later endured long-term mental illness.
