# Maqbool Bhat to Arshad Mahmood Ansari

**My dear Arshad Mahmood Ansari,**

**Assalamu Alaikum,**

I received your letter in the last week of the previous month. I apologise for the delay in replying, as circumstances prevented me from responding sooner. However, I was pleased to learn that you are well. May Allah keep your resolve strong and your aspirations unwavering.

It hardly needs repeating that despair has no place in the life of a true believer. To succumb to hopelessness is the mark of utter cowardice. Those who dedicate their lives to ideals and causes cannot be touched by despondency, for their existence becomes one of relentless pursuit and struggle. They are not tormented by the question of whether they will reach their destination; rather, their joy lies in the fact that their caravan continues its journey. To keep this caravan moving forward, they do not shy away even from embracing the gallows.

For the faithful, life and its endeavours hold an entirely different meaning—a meaning more profound and divine than the intrigue of worldly affairs. Thus, adversity and the despair, regret, and despondency of those around them do not dispirit them. For them, life takes the form of an unceasing process—ever in motion, ever young—through which they contribute to the embellishment of human history. Truly fortunate are those who earn the privilege of being part of this procession of humanity. And where, then, is there any room for sorrow or lament? Pray that, despite our shortcomings and frailties, Allah grants us the strength to take our place in this assembly of the faithful, each according to our capacity.

You mentioned the arrest of our dear comrades **Azeem Dutt, Tahir Naeem Ansari, and Mir Khalid Mahmood** in Azad Kashmir.¹ It is unbefitting of any civilised government to suppress the legitimate political activities of students and young people through imprisonment. Every person who values humanity must protest against such actions. However, I remain hopeful—and indeed certain—that only through such trials, including the ordeal of imprisonment, can our youth truly nurture and serve the ideals and values that we, as a nation, cherish and strive to attain. These trials only serve to spur the momentum of our struggle.

By the grace of the Almighty, my health remains perfectly fine, and I endure the days of imprisonment with patience and gratitude. All other circumstances remain unchanged. It would please me greatly if you could convey my well-being to our mutual friends and extend my heartfelt regards to them.

Once again, my sincere greetings to you and your companions.

**Yours sincerely,**  
## *Muhammad Maqbool Bhat*
