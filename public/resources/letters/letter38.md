# Maqbool Bhat to Master Muhammad Maqbool

**Dear Brother Muhammad Maqbool Khan Sahib,**

Peace be upon you. I hope you are in good health and safety.

A few days ago, my brother Ghulam Nabi came here from Kashmir for a visit. He conveyed the heartbreaking news that our sister Fatima¹ has departed from this worldly life. Inna lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji'un. The personal grief this tragic news has brought me cannot be expressed in these lines. It is a universal truth that every living being eventually leaves this mortal realm; however, the circumstances under which both Raja and now Fatima have left us are so painful and sorrowful that the wounds they leave behind may never fully heal. For any human being with a sensitive heart, what could be more devastating and heart-wrenching than being deprived of the opportunity to share in the grief of their loved ones during their final moments simply due to the relentless constraints of circumstances? In such situations, what can be offered except for tears of helplessness? The truth is that the cruelty of the circumstances has reached such levels that even the gift of tears has dried up under the pressure of time. In such moments, silence in mourning is the only recourse.

Nevertheless, as believers, we must submit to the will of the Divine. It is not necessary for us to understand all the nuances of divine intention. In the current state, beseeching for patience and steadfastness from the Divine Court is indeed the best approach. I hope you will join me in this prayer. I pray that the Gracious God grants the departed a place in His mercy and bestows upon us, the bereaved, the blessing of enduring patience.

I apologize for addressing you after so many years; it is not that you have slipped from my memory or that the bond we share has diminished in freshness and strength. There were circumstances that compelled me, and some personal concerns and reasons that prevented me from maintaining direct correspondence with you against my wishes. I trust you will understand these concerns and reasons. However, if you feel any resentment regarding this matter, I humbly apologize. I am certain that you would not perceive this situation as a deliberate neglect or indifference on my part.

By the grace of God, I am in good health, and I am spending my days of imprisonment with patience and gratitude. I have filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court for further legal proceedings concerning my case, which will be heard in mid-July. My lawyers are quite hopeful in this regard. We shall see what the future holds. I hope your prayers will accompany me so that this phase of trials and tribulations will conclude favorably. I have not received any letters from Javaid and Shaukat for a long time. However, I recently had the opportunity to see the letters they wrote to my brother Ghulam Nabi. Thankfully, he is in good health. Moreover, with your presence, I have no concerns regarding their guidance in the right direction. Your support and guidance will undoubtedly fill the void they have felt in my absence.

I would be pleased if you could take the trouble to inform me in detail about your and all your family members’ well-being. Please also write about the educational and professional pursuits of dear Manzoor Ahmed² and Abdul Ghaffar Ahmed³.

Please convey my warm regards to all relatives and friends, and my love to the children.

Wassalam,  
In need of your prayers,  
**Muhammad Maqbool Bhat**
