# Maqbool Bhat to Yusuf Zargar

**Camp Jail, Lahore**  
**30 January, 1973**

**Brother Zargar Sahib, Assalamu Alaikum,**

Believe me that it is because of you and your love that in these dark and gloomy dungeons of misery, the lamps of hope are still glowing. It is not possible that you wouldn’t be present in my thoughts for even a moment. The love and affection of friends like you, and the passion for sacrifice and selflessness is my greatest asset. An asset that one can be proud of, and greatly rely upon.

Recently **Naseem Sahab¹**, along with **Abdullah²**, paid me a visit. They delivered to me your message of love, and your priceless gift³, which I believe you sent to refresh in me the memories of days gone by.

You see, these memories of the past are fascinating — so beautiful that I feel pride in them, but at the same time, they are so full of pain and sadness that my heart seethes with grief.

Keep aside the recent political affiliations, your message of love has stirred a tempest in the ocean of memories. I spent hours lost in this great sea, lost in memories of the days when we, in the spirit of our youth, and with outstanding devotion, used to participate to the best of our abilities in the struggle for freedom of our subjugated homeland. The memories of the beautiful city⁴ that gave birth to you and prosperity to me, are still alive in me. The streets where once upon a time you used to jubilantly shout slogans of **Aazadi**, where you in your spirit of truthfulness used to cheerfully endure the cruelty of the enemies of Aazadi.

By Allah, the pale beams of sunlight that fall upon this sorrowed and turbulent city, its desolate ambience, and its doors and walls will bear witness to **Yousuf’s⁵**, **Mufti’s⁶**, **Parvez’s⁷**, and **Abdullah’s⁸** love and zeal, their unfeigned affinity to the idea of liberation, and the troubles they faced in this struggle for Aazadi. What else can be a source of pride for me, other than the fact that I got the opportunity to be a part of this active and spirited fraternity, and that I was the recipient of their kindness and affection. How can one forget the moments when Yousuf and Abdullah received lashes on their bare backs, and were imprisoned in Srinagar, their crime being the passion for Aazadi?

Or how can the pain felt on the forced exile⁹ of Parvez and Mufti be forgotten? Can the love and affection be forgotten, which were a part of **Badru’s¹⁰**, **Hawabaz’s¹¹**, and **Professor Maqbool Ahmad Sheikh’s¹²** pristine political character?

Only Allah knows the plight of this prisoner, who is sitting in a corner of this cage. Albeit, what else can be a source of consolation other than the memories of companionships of the past, replete with memories of love. One by one, the memories from this vast treasure keep coming to my mind. It is not possible to describe all of them. I’m afraid that in the process of penning down the memories, each word that comes out of the tip of the pen carries with it the burden of sorrow, which will distress your heart. Thus, I will stop for now.

It is true that the relation between you and me is to some extent political, and you would be surprised by the apolitical things I have mentioned till now. But you cannot deny the bond of love and friendship between us, which existed even at the time when you joined our rival political group¹³. I am sure that even during those times, you had nothing but love and compassion for me in your heart. Thereafter, when we were set on the same political ideology, and you in your peculiar joviality joined our group in Muzaffarabad expressing your love in the form of tears. Those years will be an everlasting ornament to our boundless friendship.

I received the **Kulchas** you sent via Abdullah. This gift of yours may seem to be a mere thing meant to be eaten, but you cannot imagine that in this state of imprisonment far from my homeland, their aroma and taste seems astonishing. When I first reached Baramulla in Occupied Kashmir in connection with the **National Liberation Front (NLF)**, this great friend of mine whose sincere love and companionship was with me even during the time I was under arrest, and on whose bright face used to be a beautiful smile even during the storms of pain and agony, on the very first day he asked from me my favourite foodstuff. He thought that eight years of exile from my homeland would have changed my tastes. I replied that **Namkeen Chai, Kulcha, and Saag** were assured on my part, and in addition whatever his wish. He was taken by surprise and to some extent thought of my demand as a display of modesty. But when I pressingly told him of my longing and desire for these eatables from my homeland, and made him aware that in these moments of respite, one’s longing and infatuation for these familiar things from the past increases manifold, he finally had to give in and agree. This friend of mine, who had always been an elegant host, **Jinab Ghulam Muhammad Shameem¹⁴**, whom we even in our student days used to respectfully address as *“Ghulam Muhammad Sahab”*, had to give up the traditional Kashmiri way of hospitality for me.

I think I have written too long a letter in a spate of emotions. I didn’t even consider that it might bore you. But due to the bond that we share, my heart didn’t want me to stop. Keep me informed of the milieu in Muzaffarabad. How are our other friends and fellows? And how is **Lala¹⁵**? How are **Akbar Sahab¹⁶**, **Qureshi Sahab¹⁷**, **Nazir Sahab**, and **Hanif Sahab¹⁸**?

Are **Jaseeb Ju¹⁹** and **Bashir Ahmad Lone²⁰** Sahab doing fine? What is **Abdul Sattar²¹** doing these days? Convey my greetings to all these beloved friends. Send my salaams to **Abdul Gaffar Reshi²²**, **Maqbool Naik²³**, and if possible, to **Mohammad Yaseen²⁴** as well.

Shall I have faith that in your presence the lamp of **Tehreek-e-Azadi** that we lit with our blood will continue to glow even in the storms of hostility and animosity, and with its light will continue to guide those who seek the truth on the correct path? If that is the case, then the hardships me and my fellows are facing in this prison are not in the least painful for us. Please remember to convey my greetings to **Irshad Sahab** and **Mufti Sahab** too.

Keep informing me of your well-being. I sincerely hope that you and **Bhabi Ji** would be happy and gleeful.

**Your Brother,**
