# Maqbool Bhat to Javaid Maqbool Bhat (Son)

*In the name of Allah, the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful.*

**My dear son, Javaid Maqbool Bhat**

**As-Salaam-u-Alaikum**

A few days ago, I received the heart-wrenching news that your noble mother and my wife has passed away. *(Inna Lillahi Wa Inna Elayhi Raajoun \[1\]).* It is not difficult for me to imagine the agony and shock that you must have gone through, and the intensity of pain you must have suffered—especially in my absence. But in the testing time we are going through, there is nothing that can be done except to remain patient and thankful. It is my duty to stress upon you to maintain patience. I hope that in this tragic situation, you will hold firmly to patience, control yourself, and deal with daunting circumstances with human endurance. You must allow no space for negativity in your life.

Never forget that Allah tests only those people who possess the ability to succeed in those trials. However, to make use of this ability is the prerogative of human beings. I believe that you, too, will utilise your abilities without bowing your head, and will continue your journey on the path of positivity that you have chosen for your life \[2\]. **In’Al’aha MaAs’ Saabireen \[3\]**—place complete faith in this.

I had received the news of your mother’s death some days ago, but I was waiting for more details from you. Yesterday, however, I learned from a condolence letter written by one of my friends in London that this tragic incident occurred while you were in Faisalabad (Pakistan) for your education. The fact that both of us were deprived of her company at the moment she breathed her last has doubled my sorrow. I hope that in future you will inform me in detail about her passing away, and more importantly, about her last wishes—if you are aware of them.

I need not repeat that after her death, the responsibility of managing our small family now rests upon your shoulders—a family that I had left behind. To protect it from disintegration and to bind it together with the ties of unity is now your obligation. I hope that you will not neglect this duty in any manner. As the eldest son, I have great expectations from you, and I firmly believe that you will leave no stone unturned in fulfilling this responsibility.

Through **Ghulam Nabi Bhat** (my brother), I received a letter from you which you had written in June and which reached me in the first week of September. I had dispatched a reply to your Muzaffarabad address. If it was redirected from there, you may not have received it. Your Faisalabad address was later conveyed to me by **Hashim Qureshi** in his condolence letter, which I received a few days ago. Therefore, I am sending this letter to Faisalabad. I would be pleased if you inform me in detail about your educational pursuits and also about the difficulties you may be facing.

For quite some time now, I have not received any letter regarding the well-being of dear **Showkat**. From a recent letter I received from Ghulam Nabi, I learned that Showkat has passed his matriculation, and from another letter from Peshawar, I was informed that he has taken admission in FSc. I will be waiting to hear further details about this from you.

Once again, I emphasise patience and contentment. Hold firmly to the belief that after every dark night of oppression, the dawn of bliss appears, radiant with its full splendour. Therefore, do not allow sadness and remorse to settle in your heart, and do not make any mistake on the path toward achieving your independence.

I pray that Allah may always shower you with His mercy and grant you happiness.

Convey my *Salaam* to all friends, relatives, and loved ones—rank by rank—and my affection to all the children in the family.

As for my health, it is absolutely fine. I am passing my days in captivity with patience and gratitude. There is no need to worry about me, for whatever has been decreed for me, accepting it with contentment has become a mark of my faith and determination. Continue to pray for me.

**Notes**

**\[1\]** Maqbool Bhat’s wife, **Ra’ja Begum**, was an extremely patient and grateful woman. The incarceration of her husband and his political activities subjected her to hardships and shocks at every stage of her life, which she bore with remarkable resilience. She passed away on **16 September 1980** in Abbottabad, where she is buried.

**\[2\]** Javaid Maqbool Bhat was a student of **BSc (Hons) Agriculture** at the **University of Agriculture, Faisalabad**.

**\[3\]** *Verily, Allah is with the patient ones.*
