# Maqbool Bhat to Abdul Aziz Bhat (Uncle)

**Central Jail, New Delhi**  
**17th January 1980**

**Respected Uncle,**

**Assalamu Alaikum,**

I hope this letter finds you in good health. I received your letter dated 6th December and was relieved to hear about the well-being of you and the rest of the family. For that, I am deeply grateful to the Almighty. I constantly pray for your health and safety, and with the strength of your prayers, I remain in good health myself, enduring these days of captivity with patience and gratitude. Please continue to keep me in your prayers. I have complete faith that through them, all our difficulties will be resolved.

You mentioned the claim in your letter. Please continue your efforts regarding this. I am hopeful that you will succeed. However, if you face significant obstacles, there are alternative ways to proceed. Let me know as soon as possible through a letter if any such difficulty arises. Also, consult my brother **Master Mohammad Maqbool** on this matter. Convey to him my request to take a keen interest in this issue. If you show him my letter, he will surely assist you as per my instructions. It is evident that with my clear guidance, he cannot possibly suggest anything contrary.

I have already written to you in several letters that there is no need to distribute the money from the house. Until a final decision is made regarding my case, the instructions I have given earlier must be followed.

Brother **Ghulam Nabi** has not yet visited from Kashmir, which has delayed the sending of the power of attorney. There has been heavy snowfall there these days¹, making travel difficult. Nevertheless, I have written to him, urging him to visit me as soon as possible and to maintain correspondence with you. I expect he will come soon and bring the power of attorney along so it can be sent to you. There is no need for any concern regarding this.

Now, let me write a few words for the children.

**Dear Shaukat and Shafiq²,**

How have you been? How is your studies going? You must understand how crucial your matriculation exams are. Think of them as the foundation of a building—if the foundation is weak, the entire structure is compromised. I trust that both of you will dedicate yourselves wholeheartedly to your studies and pass your exams with excellent marks. Keep in mind that securing a good division in matriculation is essential for gaining admission to college with desirable subjects. That is why you must put in your best effort now to achieve a first division. With determination and diligence, nothing is beyond reach. Make sure to write to me and let me know how you are doing.

**Sadia and Rafia, my dear daughters³,**

How are you both? How is your schooling progressing? I hope you, too, are studying with dedication and sincerity. I miss you both very much, and my prayers are always with you. A lot of love from my side. My advice to you is to learn good manners and take a keen interest in your education.

Warm regards to **Sister Hamida⁴** and **Aunt⁵**. Love to all the children. Please convey my greetings to all my friends.

**Your Son,**  
## Mohammad Maqbool Bhat

*(P.S.)* In your next letter, let me know about **Javed’s exams**—whether they have taken place or not. Also, tell Javed to write to me directly so I can inquire about his well-being.

*(Note: Uncle, if you are feeling unwell, please visit **Dr. Farooq Haider** so you can receive proper treatment.)*
