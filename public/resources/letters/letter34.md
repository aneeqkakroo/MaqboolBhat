Maqbool Bhat to Dr. Farooq Haider
Central Jail, New Delhi
25 August 1981

Brother Farooq Haider Sahib,

Peace be upon you.

After quite a long interval, I received your affectionate letter, coincidentally on the auspicious occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr. Not only did you alleviate my concerns, but you also provided me with delightful feelings of comfort and joy in spite of the hardships of imprisonment during this festive time. Thank you for this kindness.

The bouquet of verses you sent this time has rejuvenated my spirit. This life in prison is indeed peculiar; the sense of desolation in this environment becomes even more pronounced when, after a long time, I come across a letter from a friend mentioning a beautiful couplet or literary piece. For years, I have not encountered any works by notable writers or poets, nor do I foresee any opportunity to do so until the end of this period of imprisonment. Although there is a library service in this jail for namesake, I have only been able to obtain a few exceptions in terms of quality literature. Instead, there exists an endless collection of crime fiction deemed trash, which has generally been acquired as donations from libraries in certain Western countries. While writing this letter, I pondered what I should send you in return when a song was played on the radio transistor in the adjoining cell. Its melodies and meanings were so enchanting that these two couplets stuck with me. Thus, I present them to you:

"Meri mohabbat javan rahi hai,
Sada rahi hai sada rahe gi.

Jo aag dil mein lagi hui hai,
Main to manzil ki roshni hai.

Na ye bhi hai, na ye bujhe gi,
Sada rahi hai sada rahe gi.

Tumhare pehlu mein gar mere hum,
To maut kitni haseen hogi.

Chita mein jal kar bhi yaad teri,
Sada rahi hai sada rahe gi."

(translation)

"My love has stayed forever young,
It always was, and shall remain.

The flame that burns within my heart,
Is but the light that guides my way.

It neither dims, nor will it fade—
It always was, and shall remain.

If I should die beside your grace,
Then death would wear a lovely face.

Even if I burn on funeral pyres,
The thought of you shall still remain."

My health is, by God’s grace, perfectly fine. All other matters remain unchanged.

Recently, there was considerable talk about the execution of my “sentence”, but it seems that, in light of the protests arising against this proposed decision across the homeland, those who claim to dictate fate have deemed it prudent to put the matter on hold for now. It is difficult to say which way the winds will turn next; anyway, except for the “commodity of pain,” what do the beggars of this caravan possess. No matter how many robberies the men of the times attempt, they cannot acquire anything but disgrace. This “commodity of pain” is such wealth that, despite being plundered, it cannot be taken away from those of heart. It is this priceless possession that makes it possible that even amidst “thousand deserts laid” and “countless suns arising,” there is neither moisture on the eyelids nor dust accumulating on the brows of the travelers.¹ Pray that Allah Almighty keeps us from being deprived of this precious possession during any turn of life’s journey and any trial we face; for if this possession is lost, then it will be understood that life has fallen into a loss that cannot be compensated for in this world or the next.

This Eid, I received letters from several friends and comrades. One letter is from Aman Sahib in London. I have already replied to him. I have heard that you too are planning to travel to Europe for sightseeing. May Allah grant that this letter reaches you before you begin your journey to the foreign land.

I hope you will continue this correspondence in the future. It has been quite a while since the respected Jaswāl Sahib has remembered me. I would be pleased if you could convey my greetings to all our friends and inform me of their well-being in return.

Please convey my greetings to your family and lots of love to the children. Don’t forget to reply to this letter.

Wassalam

In need of your prayers,
Muhammad Maqbool Bhat

Note: Please be sure to accept my wishes for Eid in return.

¹ Maqbool Bhat has centred the theme of the iton his own two couplets:

Hazar dasht pare, laakh aaftaab ubhrey,
Jabeen pe gard, palak par nami nahin aayi.

Kahan kahan na luta qafila faqiron ka,
Mata-e-dard mein lekin kami nahin aayi.

(translation)

Though countless deserts rose, and endless suns would blaze,
No dust upon my brow, no tears to mark my gaze.

Where have the saints not lost their sacred way—
Yet in the wealth of pain, no lessening to this day.
