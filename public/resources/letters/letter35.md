# Maqbool Bhat to Mian Ghulam Sarwar

**My dear Mr. Sarwar,**

This is to acknowledge your telegraphic message of greetings on the occasion of Eid-u-Duha. Thank you very much for the kind remembrance and expression of love and good wishes. I cannot but appreciate your choice of remembering me on this auspicious occasion, which symbolises the offer of supreme sacrifice for one's faith and ideals. History certainly does not offer a better example than the one of Prophet Ibrahim to idealise man's devotion and dedication to the cause he cherishes, as well as his perseverance, when on trial, in the pursuit of his beliefs. Given our weaknesses, we may not rise to such levels, yet we can surely follow in the footsteps of such great men at least according to our capacities. This, I think, is an obligation which no conscientious person, least of all from amongst our people, can afford to forgo, for:-

> "Yeh daur apne Ibraheem ki talaash mein hai,  
> Sanam kadah hai jahan La ilaha illallah."

*(translation)*

> "An Abraham by the age is sought to break the idols of this Hall:  
> The avowal of God's Oneness can make all these idols headlong fall."

Hope you are in the best of health and spirits. Do remember me in your prayers, please. The delivery of "detailed letter" is still awaited. My respects and good wishes for you and all other friends and well-wishers.

Yours sincerely,  
**Muhammad Maqbool Bhat**  
Ward No.16, Tihar Jail,

P.S.: I am in receipt of an Eid Greetings Telegram from Mahaz-e-Azadi Anantnag. Since it does not mention the name of its sender, I fail to make out as to how it can be answered.
