Maqbool to Showkat Maqbool (Son)
(Maqbool Bhat wrote his first letter from Tihar Jail to his son Showkat Maqbool Bhat. Due to being in a state of strict imprisonment and due to some serious necessities, Maqbool Bhat wrote this letter himself, but in the name of his younger brother Ghulam Nabi. He has addressed his son pretending to be his uncle. Throughout the letter, the word “Bhaijaan” refers to Maqbool Bhat himself. Maqbool Bhat handed over this letter to his brother for him to take it out of the jail, so that even if caught by jail authorities while checking, the letter would be in Ghulam Nabi’s name and not his own.)

New Delhi
13 May, 1979

Dear Showkat Maqbool,

Assalamualaikum

I hope that you are doing good. I recently met your father in the jail. Bhai jaan is totally fine and is hoping the same for you. The letter that you dispatched on 28 February 1979 didn’t reach him on time. He received it very late, in the first week of May. But due to some circumstance sin the Jail, he cannot respond to you at this moment. He will send you a letter as soon as the jail authorities give him some relaxations. For the time being, you can take this letter as a signal of his well being. I am more or less writing this letter in your father’s words only.

Bhaijaan was elated on knowing that all of you are fine, and he is always praying for your well being. He was also glad to know that you and your brother’s [Javaid Maqbool] education is underway. He hopes that you and your brother will focus well on your studies and remain engrossed in it, because education is a treasure which is always by your side and no matter what happens, never goes waste. Bhai jaan hopes that the hardships and troubles he is going through would not affect your life negatively, rather you should face the difficulties with courage and determination. Whatever be the result, you should not be hopeless about Allah’s rahmat (blessings), and should hope that He will do good to you. You should never forget that life and death are all in His control, and as long as a person remains firm on his Eimaan, he emerges as the final winner. What kind of a person is he who bows before these difficulties and gives up? Make endurance and courage your hallmark, and face the difficulties with all your might.

Bhai jan is certainly pained by the fact that at this stage of life, when you needed his love and guidance, he is not present with you, rather lying in this faraway prison. Not only this, what also troubles him is that the difficulties and tribulations he himself is going through are a great source of worry and inconvenience to you. Nonetheless, he is hopeful that you will endure these difficulties with patience and courage, and will continue your efforts to tread on the path of success in life.

Convey Bhaijaan’s greetings to esteemed Chacha Jaan [Abdul Aziz Bhat], Chachi Jaan [Hajirah Bibi], Bhabhi Raja [Raja Begum], and Bhabhi Zakirah [Raja begum and Zakira were Maqbool Bhat’s wives, he has referred to them as Bhabhi because he wrote this letter in his brother’s name], and other nears and dears, and send his affectionate greeting to Papu [Javaid, Showkat’s elder brother], Sobi [Saeedah – paternal cousin], Rafia, and Munni.

Also remember to convey his greetings to Sister Hameedah [paternal cousin] and her husband. Moreover, he has also sent his Salaams to your Maamu Master Sahib [Master Mohammad Maqbool], Khala Fatima [MasterMohammad Maqbool’s wife], Abdul Gaffar [Master Maqbool’s nephew], and Bhabhi Fahmeeda [Master Maqbool’s wife]. Also convey his Salaams to Riyaz Ahmad’s brothers and sisters.

Dispatch your response to the New Delhi Central Jail address so that Bhaijaan is assured that you received his letter. Moreover, send greeting to all friends and relatives on my behalf as well. Ensure that you continue writing letters to your father so as to keep him informed of your wellbeing, and remember to mention your studies and other important issues pertaining to the family in your letters. Send greetings to your Abu’s friends also.

Wassalaam

Your uncle Ghulam Nabi,

and your father Mohammad Maqbool.
