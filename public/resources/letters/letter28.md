# Maqbool Bhat to Muhammad Arif

**Central Jail, New Delhi**  
**20th June 1981**

**Dear Muhammad Arif Sahib,**

Assalamu Alaikum,

I received your letter dated 2nd June. It felt as though a lightning bolt had struck the heart. The passing of the late Sufi Muhammad Zaman Sahib—whom my heart hesitates to refer to as “late”—is a loss that no amount of tears can justly mourn.¹ The image of this great embodiment of sincerity and loyalty appears before my eyes as though he were speaking to me this very moment.

In this transient world, no living soul can escape death. What choice do we have but to bow our heads in submission before this eternal law of nature? He may have left this world, but the memories tied to him are such that they cannot be forgotten for as long as I live. His passing is a personal tragedy for me. Only I might fully grasp the depth of love he had for me, and the profound sincerity and loyalty he harboured toward me. What grieves me even more is that, in this state of forced separation, I was deprived of fulfilling the duty of companionship in the final moments of Sufi Sahib’s life. As a poet has said:

"Ek charaagh aur bujha aur baṛhī tārīkī..."²  
"Another lamp was extinguished, and the darkness deepened..."

Even amidst the sorrow and melancholy that naturally arises in our ranks from the passing of this brave soul, we must not fall into despair and hopelessness. For the late Sufi Sahib belonged to that group of humans whose every aspect of life and every action is driven by principles and ideals. These are people who do not live merely for the sake of existence, but who dedicate their lives to the fulfilment of those ideas and aspirations which they rightfully regard as humanity’s most cherished legacy. It is the struggle and effort of such truth-aware men that acquaint humanity with the true meaning of life and keeps alive the process of reform and salvation. This process not only allows individuals to realise their noble ambitions but also adorns life with the values of beauty and goodness, furnishing peace to both heart and soul.

About people of such calibre, the Divine Word says:

“You are the best nation raised for mankind: you enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong.” (Qur’an)

Indeed, those who dedicate their lives to amr bil ma'rūf wa nahi 'anil munkar—enjoining good and forbidding evil—what example could be more worthy of emulation than theirs? Pray that Allah, the Exalted, grants us the strength to tread this path, so that the light of righteous struggle kindled by the blood and spirit of people like the late Sufi Sahib and his kind never be extinguished. Ameen. What greater desire could we possibly have?

I would be grateful if you could convey my sentiments of condolence and sympathy to the bereaved family and all those associated with him regarding this sorrowful death. My prayer is that may Allah grant the departed a place in Jannat al-Firdaus, beside His chosen ones, and may He bestow upon the bereaved family the patience and strength to bear this heart-wrenching loss.

As for the recommendation you mentioned, made by the Srinagar administration to the President of India concerning my case,³ I am not at all surprised. The reality is that the group which the accidents of time have placed upon the throne of power there—there’s no point expecting goodness or welfare from them. This is not merely a momentary reaction, but a considered opinion of mine. This opinion is based on the impartial analysis I have been carrying out for several years. However, it is not possible to explain its details within this brief aerogram. Who can explain to such short-sighted people that:

"Shahādat hai manzil o maqsūd-e-mu’min, na māl-e-ghanīmat na kishwar kusha’ī."  
“Martyrdom is the believer’s goal and destination—not war booty nor conquest.”

Where wealth and conquest become the only goals, hoping for justice is not just wishful thinking—it is a sign of complete misunderstanding. Fortunately, I am suffering from neither.

Regardless of who recommends what, or who issues which verdict, my only desire is that Allah grants me strength to remain firm in faith, and that my steps do not falter during this trial and tribulation. I am confident that if Allah’s mercy continues to flow, even the fire of Nimrod will become a garden—and if He has destined martyrdom for me, then I shall embrace the cup of death upon the scaffold with a fearless smile.⁴ There is no room for anxiety or panic in this matter. Simply pray that the Almighty grants me firmness of heart.

Please convey my sincere greetings to all friends—especially to Janab Amanullah Khan.

Khuda Hafiz.  
Wassalam.  
Your well-wisher,  
**Muhammad Maqbool Bhat**

Note: A while ago, I was transferred to Ward No. 16, which is referred to in prison parlance as the “hanging barrack.” Previously, I was in isolation, but now I have the opportunity to sit and speak with fellow inmates. When writing the next letter, please don’t forget to mention Ward No. 16 in the address.

¹ Sufi Muhammad Zaman passed away on 25th May 1981. He was a resident of Mirpur and was counted among the most sincere and selfless workers of the Plebiscite Front.  

² Original verse: "Ek diya aur bujha aur baṛhī tārīkī."  
“Another lamp was extinguished, and the darkness deepened.”  

³ The Srinagar administration had written to the President of India, recommending that Maqbool Bhat not be released, but rather be hanged.  

⁴ Maqbool Bhat Shaheed fulfilled this very vow. When he was taken to the gallows, he walked fearlessly with a calm face and kissed the noose like a man of unwavering courage.
