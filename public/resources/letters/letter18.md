# Maqbool Bhat to Muhammad Arif

**Central Jail, New Delhi**

**My dear Muhammad Arif,**  
**Assalamu Alaikum wa Rahmatullah!**

The letter you wrote on **21 December** reached me here last week. The reply has been delayed for various reasons, for which I apologise. In the confines of prison life, at times, acquiring even a single aerogram is as arduous as drawing water from stone. I hope you will not be disheartened by this delay.

I do not consider myself deserving of the praise you have expressed. History is filled with such lofty aspirations and steadfastness of faith that shall continue to serve as a beacon for humanity until the end of time. It was this very exalted and supreme virtue that taught **Ishmael** the etiquette of filial duty. It was the same essence of life through which **Jesus (peace be upon him)** willingly embraced the cross, and it was due to this very quality that, despite being bloodied in the marketplace of **Taif**, the blessed forehead of the **Prophet (peace be upon him)** did not bear a single crease of grief or sorrow.

These, indeed, were magnificent and unparalleled figures, but beyond them, history bears witness to countless other examples where men, in pursuit of the purpose of life, stood in defiance of the ruling forces of their time and even offered their lives as a sacrifice. We do not claim to be their equals, yet despite our weaknesses and shortcomings, we can at least strive to follow in their footsteps as much as possible. Pray that Allah grants us the strength to emulate these men of faith and resolve so that we may nurture the very ideals to which we have dedicated our lives. What more could we ask from the Almighty?

As for the question of adversity and the trials and tribulations that arise, it is essential to understand that these are but an intrinsic part of the path chosen by men of faith in every era. The greater the goal and the deeper the devotion to its attainment, the lighter the burden of hardship feels. Those who embrace determination and faith as their guiding principles are certain that:

> *“How often has a small group overcome a large one.”*  
> **(Qur’an)**

Their devotion itself emerges as the brightest testament to their ultimate triumph. They never despair of divine justice.

It was heartening to learn that you conveyed my well-being and sincere regards to my dear brother **Amanullah Khan**. The news of his well-being brought peace to my heart. I hope you will continue to extend my greetings and good wishes to him and all other friends. My prayers remain dedicated to them. I trust that they, too, remember me in their supplications.

You mentioned your correspondence with our dear **Ghulam Nabi**—please convey my greetings to him and his companions. May Allah grant them success in their noble endeavours. What else can I do for them from such a distance and in this state except pray? My knowledge of their situation is limited, yet under the circumstances, there is no need to know more.

By the grace of Allah, my health is perfectly fine, and I am spending these days of captivity with patience and gratitude. Everything else remains as it was. This brief letter cannot accommodate a detailed account of circumstances. For myself, I only ask for your prayers.

**With peace,**  
**Yours sincerely,**
