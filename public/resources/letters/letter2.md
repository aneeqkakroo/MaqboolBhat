# Maqbool to G. M. Mufti

**Bismillahi Rehmani Raheem**

**Peshawar**  
**22 May 1960**

**Brother Mufti, Peace be upon you!**

I received your letter a few days ago but wasn’t able to respond for two days. As you know, my exams are approaching, and I’m thinking about taking studies a bit more seriously nowadays¹. Still, somehow, I spend most of my time daydreaming. Nonetheless, the urge to studying has become strong. I intentionally didn’t reply to your letter any earlier, not that it wasn’t important, but because you had left for a long journey, first to Kaghan and then to Rawalpindi. I was of the opinion that writing to you would be fruitless, until you will stop at some station.

Brother, while reading your letter, on one hand I laugh and on the other, my eyes become full of tears. I turn my laughter into a sweet poison. Recently, I got a letter from a poet friend², from Kashmir. He has written it as such that it reminded me of all the painful memories of past again. I was unwell and in sensuous for few days. Now tell me, what option do I have other than weeping? Your order is put into practice but, your program of delaying Nikah needs a second thought³.

If you can meet then we will talk. My visit to Pindi for now is impossible because the truth is that I can’t spare time even for a second. I have decided not to go anywhere out until my exams are done. That’s why I want you to visit, and please, do visit. Also, talk to Chirag-Ud-Din⁴ about the important things. Rather, bring samples and rates with you. Nylon and Lady Hamilton⁵ is what you would usually find. Anyway, in this matter you should gather necessary details yourself. There is no need for me to come there.

Rest, the mental stress you are in, you should get it out of your head. A human is always put to trials but the ability to deal with it successfully is what defines us. Keep working without any fear, inform me about the consequences of the appeal you have made⁶. Perhaps Allah will make the decision in your favor. I will pray for your success. If I can be of any help, then I’m ready to do it.

Don’t think that you are alone in this, when the time comes you will get guidance. But do pay me a visit. All problems will be discussed here. Oh, I forgot to tell you one thing, today when I went to the office of *Anjaam*, Maqbool Kashmiri⁷ was reading something in his poetic way on the office window. Maybe a Romanian novel. Khair, he looked at me for no reason as I knew he would, so I greeted him with a Salam and gave him the message from your letter. He said to me, **“Dear Postman, thank you”** and I replied **“To be a postman of a dear and true friend is better than getting familiar with a particular friend, who like a flower provides nectar to different bees.”** What would that fool have understood anyway? *(Editor’s note: read the footnotes for context)*

A notice has been published in *Kohistaan* which states that sending letters to occupied Kashmir is now permissible officially. Don’t know how true it is. If true, then it would be great.

Friend, since you left, life has not been the same⁸. Another friend from Kashmir has written some couplet, let me write it down for you:

> Tum bhi hotay, hum bhi laatay taab-e-gham,  
> Ye jehnum zaar ban jata aram.  
> Purkashish pursoaz bhi hai aur nafees,  
> Yaad aayi hai tumhari hum jalees.

Hagroo sahib⁹ has sent two letters and I’m expecting a third letter soon. Friend, do me a favor, if you meet Ghulam Nabi Mir¹⁰ then extend my greetings to him and make a complaint on my regard, that I had written a letter to him but his reply never arrived. Give him my address and tell him that it’s now his turn to write to me. Tell him to write his accurate address in the letter too. I had written him a letter on his **“University Book Depot”** address. Don’t know if he got it or not. If he got it then why didn’t he reply?

I’ll keep writing to you. It’s **10 o’clock** in the night right now. Copy is ready, I’ll give it a look and leave the office¹¹. Then I’ll sleep for the night and get busy with some other work tomorrow. Brother give my Salam to your friends.

**Well Wisher,**
