# Maqbool Bhat to Arshad Mahmood Ansari

**Dear Arshad Mahmood Ansari Sahib,**

Assalamu Alaikum!

I received your letter dated 17th March. Praise be to Allah that you are well. I have responded to all your letters regularly until now. Last time, due to unavoidable circumstances, I was delayed in writing a reply, for which I had also apologised. My effort is always to respond promptly to the letters of all friends, as any delay on my part could understandably cause concern among my circle of acquaintances. I believe that in this forced separation, this brief exchange of letters is not only the sole means of keeping our memories alive but also strengthens our feelings of closeness, expresses sincerity and affection, and thus fortifies our hopes and determination. Rest assured, there will be no negligence from my side in this regard.

Your concern is justified. However, I want to assure you that life and death are solely in the hands of the Almighty, who is not only our Creator but the Creator of the entire universe. This is not merely a belief but, for me, a truth derived from both knowledge and experience. Those who stand for righteousness in the struggle between truth and falsehood hold a unique and distinct perspective on life. It is not possible to fully articulate this perspective in the confines of this brief letter, but I will say this much: the game for which we have staked our lives is of such a nature that even in defeat, one does not truly lose. What truly matters is that a person, with complete awareness, continues to nurture the purposes of life. If the elements of awareness and purpose are removed from life, then such an existence is tantamount to death. The death of consciousness and action is, in reality, the true death. Pray that Allah keeps us all safe from this fate.

By the time this letter reaches you, even if only for a short while, you will have relished the fresh breezes of your homeland.¹ Those very breezes, whose longing and yearning intensify in exile, growing ever stronger in the agony of separation.² Nevertheless, I can only envy your good fortune. There is no remedy for the intensity of this pain, but I do seek your heartfelt prayers to keep hope alive. During your stay in the homeland, you must have had the opportunity to meet our friends in person and learn about their well-being. It would bring me great joy if you could inform me about the condition of these companions from whom I have been separated for years. Please convey my greetings and prayers to all of them. I am certain that by providing me with these details, you will once again grant me the opportunity to express my gratitude.

By the grace of the Almighty, my health is absolutely fine. Everything else remains unchanged. I continue to spend these days of imprisonment with patience and gratitude. If you have received any news of well-being from the respected Amanullah Sahib, please do inform me.

Please convey my sincere greetings to you and all your friends.

Only seeking your prayers,  
**Mohammad Maqbool Bhat**

¹ The recipient of the letter had travelled from Saudi Arabia to his home in Mirpur. He likely received this letter upon his return to Saudi Arabia.  
² Those who struggle for the honour and freedom of their homeland experience great anguish in being away from it. One can only imagine the state of this passionate devotee of Kashmir’s liberation in exile.
