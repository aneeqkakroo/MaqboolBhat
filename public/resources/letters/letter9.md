# Maqbool Bhat to Abdul Aziz Bhat (Uncle)

**Central Jail, New Delhi**  
**19th September 1979**

**Respected Uncle,**

**Assalamu Alaikum,**

I hope this letter finds you in good health. I recently received a letter from Aunt, written on 29th July. Around the same time, my brother **Ghulam Nabi** also visited me. Through his words and your letter, I learned about the current situation. I deeply feel your difficulties and hardships¹. It pains me that at a time when I should be by your side, sharing your burdens and offering my support, I am far away and unable to stand with you in your troubles. But do not worry — this time of trial will soon pass by the grace of God. One should never lose hope in His mercy, and I firmly believe that He will guide our ship safely out of this storm and towards our desired destination. Keep your trust in Him and continue your prayers. I am confident that your sincere prayers will surely be answered.

You mentioned in your letter about selling the house. My brother **Ghulam Nabi** is preparing the power of attorney, and as soon as the legal formalities are completed, it will be sent to you in your name. Please do not worry about this matter. In this regard, kindly consider the following suggestions from my side:

- When selling the house, ensure that you demand a reasonable price. Under no circumstances should it be sold for less than **one lakh and twenty-five thousand rupees**².  
- From the sale amount, keep **ten thousand rupees** for your personal expenses and pay **two thousand rupees** to **Pir Abdullah Shah of Landi Kotal**³.  
- Deposit the remaining amount in our bank account. The number of my bank account is available at home.

It would be deeply distressing for me if you were to divide the money prematurely and act on your personal whims. I believe that within a year or two, my case will reach a decision. Only after that should we consider the future. If I am released and return to you, I will personally decide on the children's future. And if it is destined that I attain martyrdom, I will provide you with the necessary advice on how to distribute this money among all the children.

I want to ensure that **Shafiq, Sabiha, and Ruqaiya** continue their education and that their future is secured alongside **Javed, Shaukat, and Lubna**. With this in mind, I do not favour the unfair distribution of funds. Until my case is resolved, the ten thousand rupees for your expenses should be sufficient. You can also rent a small house temporarily to manage for a while. If **Raja and Zakira**⁴ wish to stay with you, that would be preferable; otherwise, they are free to make their own choices. My advice on this matter is final, and it must be followed under all circumstances.

One more thing! If you have any reasonable suggestions, please inform me. Pay special attention to the children’s education and update me in detail about them.

Convey my regards to **Sister Hamida** and her husband. Lots of love to **Shafiq, Sabiha, and Ruqaiya**.  
Please pass on my greetings to all my friends.

**Truly yours,**  
**Your son,**

*(P.S.)* Keep the correspondence ongoing so that I remain informed about your situation. If you face any difficulties, please meet with my friends.
