# Maqbool to G. M. Mufti

**Peshawar, 17 August**  
**Respected Mufti Sahab,**

**Asalamualaikum!**

I got your letter along with the letter of Mr. Beigh, I wanted to reply to both of you, but couldn’t do it due to some important and unavoidable circumstances. Rest Allah knows. I want to write to you from the core of my heart but I don’t know why my mind is out of words. I was thinking, as I am writing after a long time, I should concentrate on some important lines but at the same time I feel like I should write a long story which would make me feel at ease and lift this weight off my heart but alas, you yourself know the reasons very well.

Oh yes! You had talked about some important issues in your letter. I would advice you to continue the Rawalpindi letter and book. Else neither you would benefit nor would the other party. Why should both burn in the fire for no reason? At least the soul would be at ease. Rest remains your work, which will be done. I had asked you to take a leave for 10-15 days and come visit me. Let’s see what Allah has written in your destiny. One of the works is in our hands to do. Once you come, we’ll start its process. We will get money and you will get married also.

Nowadays I feel gloomy, perhaps because there’s nothing to do. Until now Air Force hasn’t given a decision and neither has your Azad Kashmir. They are unnecessarily testing our patience. There’s no confirmation of what is happening or what will happen. I was thinking if I had to live in Peshawar then I would take admission in LLB. What are your thoughts on it?

I had also received a letter from Khaliq Parvez. He was persuading me to join him and also informed me about the starting of his of depot in Mirpur. His words were filled with respect. He had written that he would visit Peshawar after earning some money from the depot but perhaps he is still struggling, that’s why he hasn’t been able to pay a visit. He did not revert to my reply.

And yes, maybe any decision hasn’t been taken on our appeal yet. What’s the reason for it? I’ll end it here this time. Because of my writers block and low mood. Maybe your next letter would cheer me up. Do write.

**Your well wisher,**

*(Maqbool Bhat hasn’t written the year on this letter. It is assumed that the letter was written on 17 August, 1959 because as per the letter Maqbool had neither taken admission in any university nor did he have a job. It is a personal letter to his friend G. M. Mufti in which he talks about personal things and also advises his friend regarding his marriage. It is understood by the content of this letter that in these days Maqbool was trying to get a job in Pakistan Air Force or in Azad Kashmir. Maqbool Bhat had also asked for advice from his friend for pursuing LLB.)*
