# Maqbool Bhat to Malik Ghulam Sarwar

**Peace be upon you.**

**Dear Brother Ghulam Sarwar Sahib,**

I received your letter—thank you for remembering me. After our meeting, I, too, thought several times of reaching out to you, but I did not have your address. Brother Asghar Sahib also wrote me a letter from Kotli, but after my reply, he could not continue the correspondence. Thus, this connection could not be maintained. Nevertheless, now that this bond has been established, I hope you will continue to remember me from time to time. After all, where is there any room for feelings of inferiority in correspondence between friends?

There is not the slightest doubt that those who take trust in Allah as their provision and make the banner of truth their motto in the battlefield of life do not waver in their steadfastness, even while enduring arduous trials. Despite a lack of resources and unfavourable circumstances, their resolve remains unwavering, and with the conviction that *“How many a small group has overcome a large one by the permission of Allah”* (Qur’an), they continue on their chosen path. Then, with this divine assurance that *“Do not weaken and do not grieve, and you will be superior if you are believers”* (Qur’an), what power in the world can prevent them from success and triumph?

Thus, it is incorrect to claim that there is no remedy for the limitations of this world. The only condition is that one does not settle for a few buds alone. The mercy and blessings of Allah are like an endless ocean—if a person remains steadfast in effort and faith, then even the greatest miracles become possible. With this belief, there is no place for despair or hopelessness in our hearts, nor is there any need to be disheartened.

Thank you for the sincerity and affection you have expressed. In truth, the strengthening of these bonds of sincerity and love is our greatest asset. And it is because of this very asset that these moments of trial, despite all their hardships, are becoming easier to endure. The stronger and more enduring these ties are, the fewer the hardships of this journey will become.

So, pray that Allah grants us the strength to fulfill these obligations to the fullest so that we may meet the expectations that we ourselves hold dear. Remember, prayers that arise from the depths of the heart are surely answered in the divine court. After all, who else can better know the state of hearts than the Almighty Himself?

The sentiments you have expressed regarding the passing of my late wife have strengthened my courage. *“Every soul shall taste death”* (Qur’an). Man is mortal, and none can escape death. However, in this matter, my sorrow lies in the fact that in the final stages of her journey, I could not fulfill the responsibilities toward her that were mine to bear. This was Allah’s will—who could have done anything against it?

By the grace of the Almighty, my health is perfectly fine, and I am spending these days of captivity with patience and gratitude. The rest of the circumstances remain unchanged. To you, and through you to all other friends and well-wishers, I extend my heartfelt greetings of sincerity and love.

**Only seeking your prayers,**
